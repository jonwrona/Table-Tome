# TABLE TOME

<em>Table Tome</em> is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition toolbox.
Its goal is to increase the speed at which players can access
important information while crawling dungeons, in order to encourage
more exciting combat and role playing by reducing the time spent
turning pages. It is built with MEAN, a full javascript stack.


## Features

### Complete
* Spellbook with basic filtering for level, class, and school, and
a basic search bar.

### In Progress
* Improved spellbook search filtering.
* User accounts with custom access levels.
  * Basic user - can only access spells and items from the basic rules.
  * Registered user - owns a 5th edition players handbook, and
  therefore can access the full database of spells and items.
* An item table (inventory).

### The Future
* Custom spells and items.
* Per user spellbooks, where a user can keep track of spells, for
example, spells for a specific character.
* Per user inventories, for characters or stores.
* Another level of user permissions for a paid user, who can create
more than a set number of spellbooks or inventories.
* An interactive character sheet.
