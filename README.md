# TABLE TOME

<em>Table Tome</em> is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition toolbox.
Its goal is to increase the speed at which players can access
important information while crawling dungeons, in order to encourage
more exciting combat and role playing by reducing the time spent
turning pages. It is built with MEAN, a full javascript stack.
